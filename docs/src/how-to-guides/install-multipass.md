# Install Multipass

<!-- This page combines the 3 different how-to pages ([Linux](/), [macOS](/), [Windows](/)) into a single page, using conditional tabs. -->

<!-- Merged contributions by @bagustris on the Open Documentation Academy -->

This guide explains how to install and manage Multipass on your system.

```{note}
Select the tab corresponding to your operating system (e.g. Linux) to display the relevant content in each section. Your decision will stick until you select another OS from the drop-down menu.
```

## Check prerequisites

[tabs]

[tab version="Linux"]

Multipass for Linux is published as a [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/docs/), available on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/multipass). Before you can use it, you need to [install `snapd`](https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install). `snapd` is included in Ubuntu by default.

[/tab]

[tab version="macOS"]

<!--### Hypervisor.framework / hyperkit-->

The default backend on macOS is `qemu`, wrapping Apple's Hypervisor framework. You can use any Mac (M1, M2, or Intel based) with **macOS 10.15 Catalina or later** installed.

[/tab]

[tab version="Windows"]

### Hyper-V

Only **Windows 10 Pro** or **Enterprise** version **1803** ("April 2018 Update") **or later** are currently supported, due to the necessary version of Hyper-V only being available on those versions.

### VirtualBox

Multipass also supports using VirtualBox as a virtualization provider.  You can download the latest version from the [VirtualBox download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html).

## Install

[tabs]

[tab version="Linux"]

To install Multipass, run the following command:

```plain
snap install multipass
```

You can also use the `edge` channel to get the latest development build:

```plain
snap install multipass --edge
```

Make sure you're part of the group that Multipass gives write access to its socket (`sudo` in this case, but it may also be `wheel` or `admin`, depending on your distribution).

1. Run this command to check which group is used by the Multipass socket:
    ```plain
    ls -l /var/snap/multipass/common/multipass_socket
    ```
    The output will be similar to the following:
    ```plain
    srw-rw---- 1 root sudo 0 Dec 19 09:47 /var/snap/multipass/common/multipass_socket
    ```

2. Run the  `groups` command to make sure you are a member of that group (in our example, "sudo"):

    ```plain
    groups | grep sudo
    ```
    The output will be similar to the following:
    ```plain
    adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin
    ```

You can view more information on the snap package using the `snap info` command:

```plain
snap info multipass
```
