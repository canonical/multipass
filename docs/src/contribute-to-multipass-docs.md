# Contribute to Multipass docs

Our documentation is a community effort and anyone can contribute.

**We warmly welcome community contributions, suggestions, fixes and constructive feedback.**

## Documentation practice

Multipass documentation is organised according to the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework and (mostly) follows the [Canonical documentation style guide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en/).

At Canonical, we have embarked on a comprehensive, long-term project to transform documentation. Our aim is to create and maintain documentation product and practice that will represent a standard of excellence. We want documentation to be the best it possibly can be.

## How you can contribute

Multipass documentation is maintained on our Discourse forum. Every documentation page has an equivalent topic on the forum, that can be accessed by clicking the "Help improve this document in the forum" link at the bottom of the page.

To contribute to the documentation, you can leave a comment on the relevant forum topic, or edit content directly if your *Trust level* allows it. However, if your intervention is bigger than fixing a typo, it’s a good idea to comment on the page to discuss first.

Either way, your name will be added to the Contributors list at the bottom of the page.

### Formatting content 

In Discourse, content is formatted using Markdown syntax. You can also use the style toolbar in the Discourse topic editing window to format elements, if you're not familiar with Markdown.

> See also: [Discourse | Supported formatting in posts (markdown, BBCcode, and HTML ](https://meta.discourse.org/t/supported-formatting-in-posts-markdown-bbcode-and-html/239348) (in particular, the link to [`markdown-it` ](https://markdown-it.github.io/) and [CommonMark Spec ](https://spec.commonmark.org/))

A useful trick to view the Markdown source of a Discourse page is replacing `/t/<page-slug>/` in the URL with `/raw/`. For example, to view the source of the [Multipass Documentation home](https://multipass.run/docs) topic, instead of the default Discourse URL:

* `https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/multipass-documentation/8294`

try pasting this modified URL in your browser's address bar: 

* `https://discourse.ubuntu.com/raw/8294`

## Join the Open Documentation Academy

The [Canonical Open Documentation Academy](https://canonical.com/documentation/open-documentation-academy) (CODA) is a community-oriented initiative led by our Technical Authors to provide help, advice and mentorship on documentation practice in a friendly, welcoming environment. A key aim of this initiative is to help lower the barrier to successful open source software contribution by making documentation into the gateway.

> See also: [Documentation practice at Canonical](https://canonical.com/documentation). 

If you want to contribute to Multipass documentation, you can also check if there are any outstanding tasks on the [Open Documentation Academy GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/open-documentation-academy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+multipass+). This could be a great opportunity to improve your documentation practice, receive guidance and mentorship and publicly contribute to an open-source project, if that's something that interests you.

Everyone is invited join the Academy's [weekly office hours](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/documentation-office-hours/42771), listen in to presentations and participate in discussions. Live sessions are also recorded and made available on the[ Ubuntu on Air YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@UbuntuOnAir), in the[ Documentation Academy playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT03aSdabJE&list=PL-qBHd6_LXWYefHij0dJ7c9X-Q9QfFFFa&pp=iAQB).
