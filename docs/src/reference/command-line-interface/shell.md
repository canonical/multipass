# shell

The `multipass shell` command will open a shell prompt on an instance. Without any arguments, it will open the shell prompt of the [primary instance](/t/28469#primary-instance) (and also create it, if it doesn't exist). You can also pass the name of an existing instance. If the instance is not running, it will be started automatically. 

If you run `multipass shell` you'll find yourself in the *primary* instance:

```{code-block} text

Mounted '/Users/giulia' into 'primary:Home'

The full `multipass help shell` output explains the available options:

```{code-block} text
Usage: multipass shell [options] [<name>]
Open a shell prompt on the instance.

Options:
  -h, --help           Displays help on commandline options
  -v, --verbose        Increase logging verbosity. Repeat the 'v' in the short
                       option for more detail. Maximum verbosity is obtained
                       with 4 (or more) v's, i.e. -vvvv.
  --timeout <timeout>  Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the command to
                       complete. Note that some background operations may
                       continue beyond that. By default, instance startup and
                       initialization is limited to 5 minutes each.

Arguments:
  name                 Name of the instance to open a shell on. If omitted,
                       'primary' (the configured primary instance name) will be
                       assumed. If the instance is not running, an attempt is
                       made to start it (see `start` for more info).
```
