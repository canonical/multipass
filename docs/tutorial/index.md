This section helps you quickly set up and use Multipass, and introduces you to advanced features such as simulated availability zones (AZs).

## Getting started

Installing Multipass is a straightforward process but may require some prerequisite steps, depending on your host system. You can find specific installation instructions for your operating system in this guide:

- [Getting started with Multipass](tutorial-getting-started)

## Availability zones

Multipass allows you to simulate availability zones, enabling you to distribute instances across up to three zones. This is a simulation-only feature and does not correspond to actual physical zones.
