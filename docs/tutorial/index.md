Multipass is a flexible and powerful tool that can be used for many purposes. In its simplest form, you can use it to quickly create and destroy Ubuntu VMs (instances) on any host machine. But you can also use Multipass to build a local mini-cloud on your laptop, to test and develop multi-instance or container-based cloud applications.

This tutorial will help you understand how Multipass works, and the skills you need to use its main features.

## Install Multipass

Multipass is available for Linux, macOS and Windows. To install it on the OS of your choice, please follow the instructions provided in [How to install Multipass](/how-to-guides/install-multipass). 

```{note}
Select the tab corresponding to your operating system (e.g. Linux) to display the relevant content in each section. Your decision will stick until you select another OS from the drop-down menu. 
```

## Create and use a basic instance

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Linux

Start Multipass from the application launcher. In Ubuntu, press the super key and type "Multipass", or find Multipass in the Applications panel on the lower left of the desktop.

![|800x450](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/949aa05e-mp-linux-1.png) 

After launching the application, you should see the Multipass tray icon on the upper right section of the screen.

![|688x52](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/5ec546da-mp-linux-2.png) 

Click on the Multipass icon and select **Open Shell**. 

![|286x274](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/3ecc5e7d-mp-linux-2a.png) 

Clicking this button does many things in the background:
* It creates a new virtual machine (instance) named `primary`, with 1GB of RAM, 5GB of disk, and 1 CPU. See also: {ref}`primary-instance`
<!-- [Primary instance]( /t/28469#primary-instance) -->
* It installs the most recent Ubuntu LTS release on that instance. 
* It mounts your `$HOME` directory in the instance. 
* It opens a shell to the instance, announced by the command prompt `ubuntu@primary`. 

<!-- note added for https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues/3537 -->

```{caution}
If your local home folder is encrypted using `fscrypt` and you are having trouble accessing its contents when it is automatically mounted inside your primary instance, see: [Mount an encrypted home folder](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot/mount-an-encrypted-home-folder).

Let's test it. As you've just learnt, the previous step automatically mounted your `$HOME` directory in the instance. Use this to share data with your instance. More concretely, create a new folder called `Multipass_Files` in your `$HOME` directory:

![|720x405](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/fbfc8304-mp-linux-3.png) 

As you can see, a `README.md` file has been added to the shared folder. Check for the folder and read the file from your new instance:

```{code-block} text
cd ./Home/Multipass_Files/
cat README.md 
```

Sample output:

```{code-block} text
## Shared Folder

This folder could be a great place to keep files that need to be accessed by both your host machine and Ubuntu VM!
```

Congratulations, you've got your first instance! 

This instance is great for when you just need a quick Ubuntu VM, but let's say you want a more customised instance, how can you do that? Multipass has you covered there too.

```{dropdown} Optional Exercises

Exercise 1: 
When you select Open Shell, what happens in the background is the equivalent of the CLI commands `multipass launch –name primary`  followed by  `multipass shell`. Open a terminal and try `multipass shell` (if you didn't follow the steps above, you will have to run the `launch` command first).

Exercise 2: 
In Multipass, an instance with the name "primary" is privileged. That is, it serves as the default argument of `multipass shell` among other capabilities. In different terminal instances, check `multipass shell primary` and `multipass shell`. Both commands should give the same result.
```

## Create a customised instance

Multipass has a great feature to help you get started with creating customised instances. Open a terminal and run the `multipass find` command. The result shows a list of all images you can currently launch through Multipass.

Launch an instance running Ubuntu 22.10 ("Kinetic Kudu") by typing the `multipass launch kinetic` command.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Linux

Now, you have an instance running and it has been named randomly by Multipass. In this case, it has been named "coherent-trumpetfish".

```{code-block} text
$ multipass launch kinetic
Launched: coherent-trumpetfish
```

You can check some basic info about your new instance by running the following command:

`multipass exec coherent-trumpetfish -- lsb_release -a`

This tells multipass to run the command `lsb_release -a` on the "coherent-trumpetfish" instance.

```{code-block} text
$ multipass exec coherent-trumpetfish -- lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 22.10
Release:		22.10
Codename:		kinetic
```

Perhaps after using this instance for a while, you decide that what you really need is the latest LTS version of Ubuntu, with a more informative name and a little more memory and disk. You can delete the "coherent-trumpetfish" instance by running the following command:

`multipass delete coherent-trumpetfish`

You can now launch the type of instance you need by running this command:

`multipass launch lts --name ltsInstance --memory 2G --disk 10G --cpus 2`

````

````{tab-item} macOS

Now, you have an instance running and it has been named randomly by Multipass. In this case, it has been named "breezy-liger".

```{code-block} text
$ multipass launch kinetic
Launched: breezy-liger
```

You can check some basic info about your new instance by running the following command:

`multipass exec breezy-liger -- lsb_release -a`

This tells Multipass to run the command `lsb_release -a` on the “breezy-liger” instance.

```{code-block} text
$ multipass exec breezy-liger -- lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 22.10

```

Perhaps after using this instance for a while, you decide that what you really need is the latest LTS version of Ubuntu, with a more informative name and a little more memory and disk. You can delete the "breezy-liger" instance by running the following command:

`multipass delete breezy-liger`

You can now launch the type of instance you need by running this command:

`multipass launch lts --name ltsInstance --memory 2G --disk 10G --cpus 2`

````

````{tab-item} Windows

Now, you have an instance running and it has been named randomly by Multipass. In this case, it has been named "decorous-skate".

```{code-block} text
C:\WINDOWS\system32> multipass launch kinetic
Launched: decorous-skate
```

You can check some basic info about your new instance by running the following command:

`multipass exec decorous-skate -- lsb_release -a`

This tells Multipass to run the command `lsb_release -a` on the “decorous-skate” instance.

```{code-block} text

`multipass delete decorous-skate`

You can now launch the type of instance you need by running this command:

`multipass launch lts --name ltsInstance --memory 2G --disk 10G --cpus 2`

## Manage instances

You can confirm that the new instance has the specs you need by running `multipass info ltsInstance`.

`````{tab-set}

```

You've created and deleted quite a few instances. It is time to run `multipass list` to see the instances you currently have.

```{code-block} text
$ multipass list

ltsInstance             Running           10.110.66.139    Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
```

The result shows that you have two instances running, the "primary" instance and the LTS machine with customised specs. The "coherent-trumpetfish" instance is still listed, but its state is "Deleted". You can recover this instance by running `multipass recover coherent-trumpetfish`. But for now, delete the instance permanently by running `multipass purge`. Then run `multipass list` again to confirm that the instance has been permanently deleted.

You've created and deleted quite a few instances. It is time to run `multipass list` to see the instances you currently have.

```{code-block} text
C:\WINDOWS\system32> multipass list                                         
Name                    State             IPv4             Image
primary                 Running           10.110.66.242    Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
decorous-skate          Deleted           --               Not Available
ltsInstance             Running           172.22.115.152   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
```

The result shows that you have two instances running, the "primary" instance and the LTS machine with customised specs. The "decorous-skate" instance is still listed, but its state is "Deleted". You can recover this instance by running `multipass recover decorous-skate`. But for now, delete the instance permanently by running `multipass purge`. Then run `multipass list` again to confirm that the instance has been permanently deleted.

You've now seen a few ways to create, customise, and delete an instance. It is time to put those instances to work!

## Put your instances to use

Let's see some practical examples of what you can do with your Multipass instances:

* {ref}`run-a-simple-web-server`
* {ref}`launch-from-a-blueprint-to-run-docker-containers`

(run-a-simple-web-server)=
### Run a simple web server

One way to put a Multipass instance to use is by running a local web server in it.

Return to your customised LTS instance. Take note of its IP address, which was revealed when you ran `multipass list`. Then run `multipass shell ltsInstance` to open a shell in the instance.

From the shell, you can run:

```{code-block} text
sudo apt update

sudo apt install apache2
```

Open a browser and type in the IP address of your instance into the address bar. You should now see the default Apache homepage.

````

`````

Just like that, you've got a web server running in a Multipass instance!

You can use this web server locally for any kind of local development or testing. However, if you want to access this web server from the internet (for instance, a different computer), you need an instance that is exposed to the external network.

(launch-from-a-blueprint-to-run-docker-containers)=
### Launch from a Blueprint to run Docker containers

Some environments require a lot of configuration and setup. Multipass Blueprints are instances with a deep level of customization. For example, the Docker Blueprint is a pre-configured Docker environment with a Portainer container already running. 

You can launch an instance using the Docker Blueprint by running `multipass launch docker --name docker-dev`.

Once that's done, run `multipass info docker-dev` to note down the IP of the new instance.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Linux

```{code-block} text
$ multipass launch docker --name docker-dev
Launched: docker-dev
$ multipass info docker-dev
Name:           docker-dev
State:          Running
IPv4:           10.115.5.235
                172.17.0.1
Release:        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Image hash:     3100a27357a0 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
CPU(s):         2
Load:           1.50 2.21 1.36
Disk usage:     2.6GiB out of 38.6GiB
Memory usage:   259.7MiB out of 3.8GiB
Mounts:         --
```

Copy the IP address starting with "10" and paste it into your browser, then add a colon and the portainer default port, 9000. It should look like this: 10.115.5.235:9000. This will take you to the Portainer login page where you can set a username and password.

From there, select **Local** to manage a local Docker environment.

![|720x601](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/ee3ff308-mp-linux-6.png) 

Inside the newly selected local Docker environment, locate the sidebar menu on the page and click on **app templates**, then select **NGINX**.

![|720x460](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/86be3eae-mp-linux-7.png) 

From the Portainer dashboard, you can see the ports available on nginx. To verify that you have nginx running in a Docker container inside Multipass, open a new web page and paste the IP address of your instance followed by one of the port numbers.
