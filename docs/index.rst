Documentation starter pack
==========================

The documentation starter pack helps you to quickly set up, build, and publish documentation with Sphinx.

It contains common styling and configuration through the `Canonical Sphinx`_ extension, supports both |RST| and Markdown, and includes automatic documentation checks.

The :ref:`quickstart` gives you a basic idea of how to start.
Detailed information is available for :ref:`setting up your documentation <setup>` and for :ref:`updating it <update>`.

You can also find detailed information about the :ref:`automatic-checks` included in the starter pack, and a :ref:`list of projects <examples>` that use the starter pack.
