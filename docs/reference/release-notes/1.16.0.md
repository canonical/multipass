(1.16.0)=
# 1.16.0

These release notes cover new features and changes in Multipass 1.16.0.

We're pleased to announce Multipass 1.16.0, where the entire code base became fully open source! This is a consolidation release, bringing a ton of improvements to our GUI, fixes to the Multipass daemon/service, as well as important security enhancements.

## New features & improvements

### Fully open source

Previously proprietary bits for Windows and macOS are now unified within [canonical/multipass](https://github.com/canonical/multipass).

### Custom image launch

Custom image launch is now supported on macOS and Windows too (with `file://` or `https://` URLs).

### GUI improvements

* Facilitate reusing launch configurations with a button to "Launch and configure next"
* Support zoom in the terminal (use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> together with <kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>, or <kbd>0</kbd>)
* Start VMs with the "Open shell" button
* Remember window size + better default sizes

### Other improvements

* Support the QEMU driver on ARM Linux hosts
* Improve copy-paste support
* Improve gRPC security with standard mTLS
* Update almost all our dependencies and move some more to vcpkg
* {ref}`index` documentation has been migrated to ReadTheDocs and included in [this repository](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/tree/main/docs).

## Deprecations

* LXD and libvirt drivers are being deprecated, along with [blueprints](explanation-blueprint). The plan is to remove them in the next feature release.
* This is also likely to be the last release that will support macOS 13.

## Bug fixes

* Fix 5 different crash conditions ([#3978](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/3978), [#4004](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/4004), [#4006](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/4006), [#4010](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/4010), [#4016](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/4016))
* Fix issues with mounts, file transfer, and SSH ([#3902](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/3902), [#3971](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/3971), [#3959](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/3959), [#4007](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/pull/4007))
