# info

The `multipass info` command shows properties of instances and snapshots. 

For example, `multipass info calm-squirrel`:

```{code-block} text
Name:           calm-squirrel
State:          RUNNING
Snapshots:      2
IPv4:           10.218.69.109
Release:        Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
Image hash:     2461b36d86ac (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
CPU(s):         1
Load:           0.49, 0.70, 0.71
Disk usage:     849.4M out of 4.8G
Memory usage:   41.9M out of 992.0M
Mounts:         /home/user => Home
                    UID map: 1000:default
                    GID map: 1001:default
                /home/user/multipass => mp
                    UID map: 1000:default
                    GID map: 1001:default
```

or, in case of a snapshot, `multipass info relative-lion.snapshot3`:

```{code-block} text
Snapshot:       snapshot3
Instance:       relative-lion
CPU(s):         1
Disk space:     5.0GiB
Memory size:    1.0GiB
Mounts:         --
Created:        2023-10-30T13:31:37.239Z
Parent:         snapshot1
Children:       --
Comment:        Before restoring snapshot2
```

To obtain information on all the snapshots of an instance, you can specify the name of the instance and add the `--snapshots` option to the command. 

With no positional arguments, `multipass info` displays information on all the instances. If you add the `--snapshots` flag and no positional arguments, the command displays information on all the snapshots of all instances.

The `--format` option allows to choose how the output is formatted. The available options are a human-readable `table`, or machine-readable formats: `json`, `yaml` or `csv`. 

For example, the command `multipass info --format yaml calm-squirrel` produces the following output:

```{code-block} text
errors:
  - ~
calm-squirrel:
  - state: RUNNING
    snapshot_count: 2

## Details available for instances and snapshots

Here you can find a comprehensive list of the details that `multipass info` provides for instances and snapshots, respectively. 

### Instance details

|Entry      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  `Name`  |  Name of the instance that the information pertains to  |
|  `State`   |  Current state of the instance (see also: [Instance states](/reference/instance-states))  |
| `Snapshots` | Number of snapshots of the instance |
| `IPv4` | A list of IPs through which a machine on the same network as the instance can reach the instance. Adding IP addresses besides the one automatically generated by Multipass is described in {ref}`create-an-instance-with-multiple-network-interfaces`. <!-- [How to create an instance with multiple network interfaces]( /t/27188#create-an-instance-with-multiple-network-interfaces) --> |
| `Release` | Title of the release of the image installed on this instance |
| `Image hash` | The SHA-256 hash of the aforementioned image. This can be used to verify the validity of the image. |
| `CPU(s)` | Number of cores that the instance can use, as defined by the `--cpus` option of the [`launch`](/reference/command-line-interface/launch) command or as modified by the [`local.<instance-name>.cpus`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-cpus) key of the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. Depending on the used driver, this value can exceed the number of CPUs on the host machine. |
| `Load` | A triplet of values describing the average number of processes running on the CPU or in queue waiting for CPU time, sampled over the last 1 minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes respectively. The values are normalized to the number of CPU cores, so for a machine with N cores, a load average of N indicates that the CPU is utilized at maximum capacity over the respective time interval, while a value below or above N indicates that the CPU is either under-utilized or over-utilized. |
| `Disk usage` | Amount of disk space used by the instance, as defined by the `--disk` option of the [`launch`](/reference/command-line-interface/launch) command or as modified by the [`local.<instance-name>.disk`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-disk) key of the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. |
| `Memory usage` | Amount of memory used by the instance, as defined by the `--memory` option of the [`launch`](/reference/command-line-interface/launch) command or as modified by the [`local.<instance-name>.memory`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-memory) key of the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. Depending on the used driver, the total value can exceed the amount of memory available on the host machine, but the used value cannot. |
| `Mounts` | List of directories on the host machine that are accessible through their respective directories from inside the instance. Each directory mapping has a list of UID and GID mappings, representing how the ownership of their respective host directories is translated the ownership of their respective instance directories. See also: [Mount](/explanation/mount). |

### Snapshot details

|Entry      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Snapshot` | Name of the snapshot that the following details pertain to, as defined by the `--name` option of the [`snapshot`](/reference/command-line-interface/snapshot) command or by the [`local.<instance>.<snapshot>.name`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-snapshot-name-name) key on the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. |
| `Instance` | Name of the instance that snapshot belongs too |
| `CPU(s)` | Number of cores that were assigned to the instance when the snapshot was taken, as defined by the `--cpus` option of the [`launch`](/reference/command-line-interface/launch) command or as modified by the [`local.<instance-name>.cpus`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-cpus) key of the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. |
| `Disk space` | Size of the instances disk when the snapshot was taken, as defined by the `--disk` option of the [`launch`](/reference/command-line-interface/launch) command or as modified by the [`local.<instance-name>.disk`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-disk) key of the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. |
| `Memory size` | Amount of memory that was assigned to the instance when the snapshot was taken, as defined by the `--memory` option of the [`launch`](/reference/command-line-interface/launch) command or as modified by the [`local.<instance-name>.memory`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-memory) key of the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. |
| `Mounts` | List of directories on the host machine that were mounted inside the instance at the time that the snapshot was taken. See also: [Mount](/explanation/mount). |
| `Created` | Timestamp containing the date and time when the snapshot was created |
| `Parent` | The snapshot that was last in effect when this snapshot was taken, relatively to which the current snapshot records changes |
| `Children` | A list of snapshots that have this snapshot as a parent |
| `Comment` | The comment that is associated with the snapshot, as defined by the `--comment` option of the [`snapshot`](/reference/command-line-interface/snapshot) command or by the [`local.<instance>.<snapshot>.comment`](/reference/settings/local-instance-name-snapshot-name-comment) key on the [`set`](/reference/command-line-interface/set) command. |

The full `multipass help info` output explains the available options:
```{code-block} text
Usage: multipass info [options] <instance>[.snapshot] [<instance>[.snapshot] ...]
Display information about instances or snapshots

Options:
  -h, --help         Displays help on commandline options
  -v, --verbose      Increase logging verbosity. Repeat the 'v' in the short
                     option for more detail. Maximum verbosity is obtained with
                     4 (or more) v's, i.e. -vvvv.
  --snapshots        Display detailed information about the snapshots of
                     specified instances. This option has no effect on snapshot
                     arguments. Omit instance/snapshot arguments to obtain
                     detailed information on all the snapshots of all instances.
  --format <format>  Output info in the requested format.
                     Valid formats are: table (default), json, csv and yaml.

Arguments:
  instance/snapshot  Names of instances or snapshots to display information
                     about
