# launch

The `multipass launch` command without any argument will create and start a new instance based on the default image, using a random generated name; for example:

```
...
Launched: relishing-lionfish
```

You can then shell into an instance by its name:

```{code-block} text
multipass shell relishing-lionfish
```

The only, optional, positional argument is the image to launch an instance from. See [`find`](/reference/command-line-interface/find) for how to find information on the available images. 

It's also possible to provide a full URL to the image (use `file://` for an image available on the host running `multipassd`).

You can change the resources made available to the instance by passing the `--cpus`, `--disk` or `--memory` options, changing the allocated CPU cores, disk space or RAM, respectively.

If you want your instance to have a name of your choice, use the `--name` option. The instance name has to be unique and conform to a specific [instance name format](/reference/instance-name-format).

By passing a filename or an URL to `--cloud-init`, you can provide user data to [`cloud-init`](https://cloud-init.io/) to customize the instance on first boot. See [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html) for examples.

Use the `--network` option to {ref}`create-an-instance-with-multiple-network-interfaces`.
<!-- [create an instance with additional network interfaces]( /t/27188#create-an-instance-with-multiple-network-interfaces) -->

Passing `--bridged` and `--network bridged` are shortcuts to `--network <name>`, where `<name>` is configured via `multipass set local.bridged-interface`.

You can also mount folders in the instance after it is launched using the  `--mount` option. It can be specified multiple times, with different mount paths.

Use the `--timeout` option to change how long Multipass waits for the machine to boot and initialize.

The full `multipass help launch` output explains the available options:

```{code-block} text
Usage: multipass launch [options] [[<remote:>]<image> | <url>]
Create and start a new instance.

Options:
  -h, --help                            Displays help on commandline options
  -v, --verbose                         Increase logging verbosity. Repeat the
                                        'v' in the short option for more detail.
                                        Maximum verbosity is obtained with 4 (or
                                        more) v's, i.e. -vvvv.
  -c, --cpus <cpus>                     Number of CPUs to allocate.
                                        Minimum: 1, default: 1.

                                        Minimum: 128M, default: 1G.
  -n, --name <name>                     Name for the instance. If it is

                                        directory is mounted inside the newly
                                        launched instance, in 'Home'.
                                        Valid names must consist of letters,
                                        numbers, or hyphens, must start with a

                                        following keys available:
                                         name: the network to connect to
                                        (required), use the networks command for
                                        a list of possible values, or use
                                        'bridged' to use the interface
                                        configured via `multipass set

  --bridged                             Adds one `--network bridged` network.
  --mount <local-path>:<instance-path>  Mount a local directory inside the

                                        the mount point will be under 
                                        /home/ubuntu/<source-dir>, where 
                                        <source-dir> is the name of the 
                                        <source> directory.
  --timeout <timeout>                   Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for
                                        the command to complete. Note that some
                                        background operations may continue
                                        beyond that. By default, instance
                                        startup and initialization is limited to
                                        5 minutes each.

Arguments:
  image                                 Optional image to launch. If omitted,
                                        then the default Ubuntu LTS will be
                                        used.
                                        <remote> can be either ‘release’ or
                                        ‘daily‘. If <remote> is omitted,
                                        ‘release’ will be used.

                                        an Ubuntu release version, codename or
                                        alias.
                                        <url> is a custom image URL that is in
