# suspend

The `multipass suspend` command without any argument will suspend the {ref}`primary-instance` (and fail, if it doesnâ€™t exist). You can also pass one or more instance names or the `--all` option to suspend more instances at the same time.

```{note}
Only instances in `Running` status can be suspended.
```

For example:

```{code-block} text
multipass stop boisterous-tortoise
multipass suspend boisterous-tortoise
```

If check your instances with `multipass list`, you'll see that its status is now set to `Suspended`:

```{code-block} text
Name                    State             IPv4             Image
boisterous-tortoise     Suspended         --               Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
```

Suspended instances can be resumed with the [`multipass start`](/reference/command-line-interface/start) command.
