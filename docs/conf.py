# Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder.
# All configuration specific to your project should be done in this file.

# If you're new to Sphinx and don't want any advanced or custom features,
# just go through the items marked 'TODO'.
#
# A complete list of built-in Sphinx configuration values:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# Our starter pack uses the custom Canonical Sphinx extension
# to keep all documentation based on it consistent and on brand:

# Copyright string; shown at the bottom of the page
#
# Now, the starter pack uses CC-BY-SA as the license
# and the current year as the copyright year.
#
# TODO: If your docs need another license, specify it instead of 'CC-BY-SA'.
#
# TODO: If your documentation is a part of the code repository of your project,
#       it inherits the code license instead; specify it instead of 'CC-BY-SA'.
#
# NOTE: For static works, it is common to provide the first publication year.
#       Another option is to provide both the first year of publication
#       and the current year, especially for docs that frequently change,
#       e.g. 2022–2023 (note the en-dash).
#
#       A way to check a repo's creation date is to get a classic GitHub token
#       with 'repo' permissions; see https://github.com/settings/tokens
#       Next, use 'curl' and 'jq' to extract the date from the API's output:
#
#       curl -H 'Authorization: token <TOKEN>' \
#         -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \
#         https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/<REPO> | jq '.created_at'
