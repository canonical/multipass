## Check prerequisites

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Linux

Multipass for Linux is published as a [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/docs/), available on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/multipass). Before you can use it, you need to [install `snapd`](https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install). `snapd` is included in Ubuntu by default.

````

````{tab-item} macOS

<!--### Hypervisor.framework / hyperkit-->

The default backend on macOS is `qemu`, wrapping Apple's Hypervisor framework. You can use any Mac (M1, M2, or Intel based) with **macOS 10.15 Catalina or later** installed.

````

````{tab-item} Windows

### Hyper-V

Only **Windows 10 Pro** or **Enterprise** version **1803** ("April 2018 Update") **or later** are currently supported, due to the necessary version of Hyper-V only being available on those versions.

### VirtualBox

Multipass also supports using VirtualBox as a virtualisation provider. You can download the latest version from the [VirtualBox download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html).

## Install

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Linux

To install Multipass, run the following command:

```{code-block} text
snap install multipass
```

You can also use the `edge` channel to get the latest development build:

```{code-block} text
snap install multipass --edge
```

Make sure you're part of the group that Multipass gives write access to its socket (`sudo` in this case, but it may also be `wheel` or `admin`, depending on your distribution).

1. Run this command to check which group is used by the Multipass socket:
   ```{code-block} text
   ls -l /var/snap/multipass/common/multipass_socket
   ```
   The output will be similar to the following:
   ```{code-block} text
   srw-rw---- 1 root sudo 0 Dec 19 09:47 /var/snap/multipass/common/multipass_socket
   ```

2. Run the `groups` command to make sure you are a member of that group (in our example, "sudo"):

   ```{code-block} text
   groups | grep sudo
   ```

   The output will be similar to the following:

   ```{code-block} text
   adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin
   ```

You can view more information on the snap package using the `snap info` command:

```{code-block} text
snap info multipass
```

Alternatively, you can also check your preferred package manager to see if it provides Multipass, although this option is not officially supported.

## Run

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Linux

You've installed Multipass. Time to run your first commands! Use `multipass version` to check your version or `multipass launch` to create your first instance.

````

````{tab-item} macOS

You've installed Multipass. Time to run your first commands! Use `multipass version` to check your version or `multipass launch` to create your first instance.

> See also: [How to set up the driver](/how-to-guides/customise-multipass/set-up-the-driver), [How to use a different terminal from the system icon](/how-to-guides/customise-multipass/use-a-different-terminal-from-the-system-icon)

````

````{tab-item} Windows

You've installed Multipass. Time to run your first commands! Launch a **Command Prompt** (`cmd.exe`) or **PowerShell** as a regular user. Use `multipass version` to check your version or `multipass launch` to create your first instance.

Multipass defaults to using Hyper-V as its virtualisation provider. If you'd like to use VirtualBox, you can do so using the following command:

```{code-block} text
multipass set local.driver=virtualbox
```
