# Authenticate clients with the Multipass service

Multipass requires clients to be authenticated with the service before allowing commands to complete.

## Setting the passphrase

The administrator needs to set a passphrase for clients to authenticate with the Multipass service. The client setting the passphrase will need to already be authenticated. 

There are two ways to proceed:

* Set the passphrase with an echoless interactive entry, where the passphrase is hidden from view:
  
   ```{code-block} text
   multipass set local.passphrase
   ```
  
   The system will then prompt you to enter a passphrase:
  
   ```{code-block} text
   Please enter passphrase:
   Please re-enter passphrase:
   ```
  
* Set the passphrase in the command line, where the passphrase is visible:

   ```{code-block} text
   multipass set local.passphrase=foo
   ```

## Authenticating the client

A client that is not authorised to connect to the Multipass service will fail when running `multipass` commands. An error will be displayed when this happens. 

For example, if you try running the `multipass list` command:

```{code-block} text
list failed: The client is not authenticated with the Multipass service.
Please use 'multipass authenticate' before proceeding.
```

At this time, the client will need to provide the previously set passphrase. This can be accomplished in two ways:

* Authenticate with an echoless interactive entry, where the passphrase is hidden from view:

    ```{code-block} text
    multipass authenticate
    ```
    
    The system will prompt you to enter the passphrase:
    
     ```{code-block} text
    Please enter passphrase:
    ```

* Authenticate in the command line, where the passphrase is visible:

   ```{code-block} text
   multipass authenticate foo
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Here you can find solutions and workarounds for common issues that may arise.

### The client cannot be authorised and the passphrase cannot be set
 
It is possible that another client that is privileged to connect to the Multipass socket will connect first and make it seemingly impossible to set the `local.passphrase` and also `authorize` the client with the service. 

If this is the case, you will see something like the following when you run:

* `multipass list`
  
  ```{code-block} text
  list failed: The client is not authenticated with the Multipass service.
  Please use 'multipass authenticate' before proceeding.
  ```

* `multipass authenticate`

  ```{code-block} text
  Please enter passphrase: 
  authenticate failed: Passphrase is not set. Please `multipass set 
  local.passphrase` with a trusted client.
  ```

* `multipass set local.passphrase`

  ```{code-block} text
  Please enter passphrase: 
  Please re-enter passphrase: 
  set failed: The client is not authenticated with the Multipass service.
  Please use 'multipass authenticate' before proceeding.
  ```

This may not even work when using `sudo`.

The following workaround should help get out of this situation:

```{code-block} text
cat ~/snap/multipass/current/data/multipass-client-certificate/multipass_cert.pem | sudo tee -a /var/snap/multipass/common/data/multipassd/authenticated-certs/multipass_client_certs.pem > /dev/null
snap restart multipass
```

You may need `sudo` with this last command: `sudo snap restart multipass`.

At this point, your client should be authenticated with the Multipass service.
