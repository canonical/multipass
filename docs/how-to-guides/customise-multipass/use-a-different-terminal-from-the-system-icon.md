# Use a different terminal from the system icon

If you want, you can change the terminal application used by the Multipass system menu icon.

```{note}
Currently available only for macOS
```

To do so, you need to tell macOS which terminal to use for the `.command` file type. This document presents two ways of achieving this.

## Using `duti`

[`duti`](https://github.com/moretension/duti/) is a small helper application that can modify the default application preferences. It's also [available from `brew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/duti).

Find out your preferred terminal's bundle identifier using `mdls`:

```console
mdls /Applications/iTerm.app/ | grep BundleIdentifier
kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier              = "com.googlecode.iterm2"
```

And make it the default for script files using `duti`:

```console
duti -s com.googlecode.iTerm2 com.apple.terminal.shell-script shell
```

## Using Finder

Create an empty file with a `.command` extension and find it in Finder. Select the file and press `âŒ˜I`. You should be presented with an information pane like this:

![file.command info|289x366](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/1ce425a9-multipass-file-command-info.png)

Expand the "Open with:" section, select your preferred terminal application and click on "Change All...".
