# How to set up the driver

> See also: {ref}`explanation-driver`, {ref}`reference-settings-local-driver`

This document demonstrates how to choose, set up, and manage the drivers behind Multipass. Multipass already has sensible defaults, so this is an optional step.

## Default driver

`````{tabs}

````{group-tab} Linux

By default, Multipass on Linux uses the `qemu` driver.

````

````{group-tab} macOS

By default, Multipass on macOS uses the `qemu` driver.

````

````{group-tab} Windows

By default, Multipass on Windows uses the `hyperv` driver.

````

`````

## Install an alternative driver

`````{tabs}

````{group-tab} Linux
```{warning}
Support for libvirt driver will be deprecated and removed in a future release.
```
If you want more control over your VMs after they are launched, you can also use the experimental [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) driver.

To install libvirt, run the following command (or use the equivalent for your Linux distribution):

```{code-block} text
sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-system
```

Now you can switch the Multipass driver to libvirt. First, enable Multipass to use your local libvirt by connecting to the libvirt interface/plug:

```{code-block} text
sudo snap connect multipass:libvirt
```

Then, stop all instances and tell Multipass to use libvirt, running the following commands:

```{code-block} text
multipass stop --all
multipass set local.driver=libvirt
```

All your existing instances will be migrated and can be used straight away.

```{note}
You can still use the `multipass` client and the tray icon, and any changes you make to the configuration of the instance in libvirt will be persistent. They may not be represented in Multipass commands such as `multipass info`, though.
```

````

````{group-tab} macOS

An alternative option is to use VirtualBox.

To switch the Multipass driver to VirtualBox, run this command:

```{code-block} text
sudo multipass set local.driver=virtualbox
```

From now on, all instances started with `multipass launch` will use VirtualBox behind the scenes.

````

````{group-tab} Windows

If you want to (or have to), you can change the hypervisor that Multipass uses to VirtualBox.

To that end, install VirtualBox, if you haven't yet. You may find that you need to <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=88405#p423658">run the VirtualBox installer as administrator</a>.

[run the VirtualBox installer as administrator](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=88405#p423658)
-->

To switch the Multipass driver to VirtualBox (also with Administrator privileges), run this command:

```{code-block} powershell
multipass set local.driver=virtualbox
```

From then on, all instances started with `multipass launch` will use VirtualBox behind the scenes.

## Use the driver to view Multipass instances

`````{tabs}

````{group-tab} Linux

You can view instances with libvirt in two ways, using the `virsh` CLI or the [`virt-manager` GUI](https://virt-manager.org/).

To use the `virsh` CLI, launch an instance and then run the command `virsh list` (see [`man virsh`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/virsh.1.html) for a command reference):

```{code-block} text
virsh list
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```{code-block} text
 Id   Name                   State
--------------------------------------
 1    unaffected-gyrfalcon   running
```
Alternatively, to use the `virt-manager` GUI, ...

```{figure} /images/multipass-virt-manager-gui.png

```

-->

````

````{group-tab} macOS

Multipass runs as the `root` user, so to see the instances in  VirtualBox, or through the `VBoxManage` command, you have to run those as `root`, too. To see the instances in VirtualBox, use the command:

```{code-block} text
sudo VirtualBox
```

```{figure} /images/multipass-macos-virtualbox-manager.png

```

<!-- Original image on the Asset Manager
![Multipass instances in VirtualBox](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/9c959eed-multipass-macos-virtualbox-manager.png)
-->

And, to list the instances on the command line, run:

```{code-block} text
sudo VBoxManage list vms
```

Sample output:
```{code-block} text
"primary" {395d5300-557d-4640-a43a-48100b10e098}
```

```{note}
You can still use the `multipass` client and the system menu icon, and any changes you make to the configuration of the instances in VirtualBox will be persistent. They may not be represented in Multipass commands such as `multipass info` , though.
[/note]

````

````{group-tab} Windows

Multipass runs as the _System_ account, so to see the instances in VirtualBox, or through the `VBoxManage` command, you have to run those as that user via [`PsExec -s`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec). Download and unpack [PSTools.zip](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip) in your *Downloads* folder, and in an administrative PowerShell, run:

```{code-block} powershell
& $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\PSTools\PsExec.exe -s -i $env:VBOX_MSI_INSTALL_PATH\VirtualBox.exe
```

```{figure} /images/multipass-windows-virtualbox-manager.png

```

<!-- Original image on the Asset Manager
![Multipass instances in VirtualBox](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/edce2443-multipass-windows-virtualbox-manager.png)

To list the instances on the command line:

```{code-block} powershell
& $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\PSTools\PsExec.exe -s $env:VBOX_MSI_INSTALL_PATH\VBoxManage.exe list vms
```

Sample output:

```{code-block} powershell
"primary" {05a04fa0-8caf-4c35-9d21-ceddfe031e6f}
```

```{note}
You can still use the `multipass` client and the system menu icon, and any changes you make to the configuration of the instances in VirtualBox will be persistent. They may not be represented in Multipass commands such as `multipass info`, though.

## Use VirtualBox to set up port forwarding for a Multipass instance

`````{tabs}

````{group-tab} Linux

This option only applies to macOS and Windows systems.

````

````{group-tab} macOS

To expose a service running inside the instance on your host, you can use [VirtualBox's port forwarding feature](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#natforward), for example:

```{code-block} text
sudo VBoxManage controlvm "primary" natpf1 "myservice,tcp,,8080,,8081"
```

You can then open, say, https://localhost:8081/, and the service running inside the instance on port 8080 will be exposed.

````

````{group-tab} Windows

To expose a service running inside the instance on your host, you can use [VirtualBox's port forwarding feature](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#natforward), for example:

```{code-block} powershell
& $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\PSTools\PsExec.exe -s $env:VBOX_MSI_INSTALL_PATH\VBoxManage.exe controlvm "primary" natpf1 "myservice,tcp,,8080,,8081"
```

You can then open, say, https://localhost:8081/, and the service running inside the instance on port 8080 will be exposed.

## Use VirtualBox to set up network bridging for a Multipass instance

`````{tabs}

````{group-tab} Linux

This option only applies to macOS systems.

````

````{group-tab} macOS

An often requested Multipass feature is network bridging. You can add a second network interface to the instance and expose it on your physical network.

First, stop the instance:

```{code-block} text
multipass stop primary
```

Now, find the network interface you want to bridge with, running the command:

```{code-block} text
VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep ^Name:
```

You want the identifier before the second colon; for example `en0` in the following sample output:

```{code-block} text
Name:            en0: Ethernet
Name:            en1: Wi-Fi (AirPort)
Name:            en2: Thunderbolt 1
Name:            en3: Thunderbolt 2
...
```

Finally, tell VirtualBox to use it as the "parent" for the second interface (for more information on this topic, see [VirtualBox documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged)):

```{code-block} text
sudo VBoxManage modifyvm primary --nic2 bridged --bridgeadapter2 en0
```

```{caution}
Do not touch --nic1 as that's used by Multipass.
```

You can then start the instance again:

```{code-block} text
multipass start primary
```

To find the name of the new interface, run this command:

```{code-block} text
multipass exec primary ip link | grep DOWN
```

In the following sample output, the name of the interface that we are looking for is `enp0s8`:

```{code-block} text
3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
```

Now, configure that new interface (Ubuntu uses [Netplan](https://netplan.io/) for that):

```{code-block} text
multipass exec -- primary sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/netplan/60-bridge.yaml" <<EOF
network:
  ethernets:
    enp0s8:                  # this is the interface name from above
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp4-overrides:       # this is needed so the default gateway
        route-metric: 200    # remains with the first interface
  version: 2
EOF

multipass exec primary sudo Netplan apply
```

Finally, find the IP of the instance given by your router:

```{code-block} text
multipass exec primary ip address show dev enp0s8 up
```

For example:

```{code-block} text
3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:2a:5f:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet <b>10.2.0.39</b>/24 brd 10.2.0.255 scope global dynamic enp0s8
       valid_lft 86119sec preferred_lft 86119sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe2a:5f55/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

All the services running inside the instance should now be available on your physical network under https://&lt;instance IP&gt;/.

## Switch back to the default driver

> See also: {ref}`reference-command-line-interface-stop`, {ref}`reference-settings-local-driver`

`````{tabs}

````{group-tab} Linux

To switch back to the default `qemu` driver, first you need to stop all instances again:

```{code-block} text
multipass stop --all
multipass set local.driver=qemu
```

Here, too, existing instances will be migrated.

```{note}
This will make you lose any customisations you made to the instance in `libvirt`.
[/note]

````

````{group-tab} macOS

If you want to switch back to the default driver, run:

```{code-block} text
multipass set local.driver=qemu
```

Instances created with VirtualBox don't get transferred, but you can always come back to them.

````

````{group-tab} Windows

If you want to switch back to the default driver:

```{code-block} text
multipass set local.driver=hyperv
```

Instances created with VirtualBox don't get transferred, but you can always come back to them.
