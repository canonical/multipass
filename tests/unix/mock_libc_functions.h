// The following mocks can't use premock directly because they are declared noexcept and the way
// premock works is that it uses decltype() to get the function types and then uses this when
// declaring the std::function.  However, in C++17, std::function can no longer be declared with a
// noexcept type, so to avoid that, we basically do what the premock macros do here but be explicit
// about the types and not use noexcept.
