Build instructions for Mac OS
=============================

Environment Setup
-----------------

### XCode

Can be installed via the App Store. Once this is done, you may need to install the command line tooling too, to do this
run:

    xcode-select --install

Ensure you have development Frameworks for at least OS X 10.8 installed, with the typical compiler toolchain and "git".
Avoid the version of cmake supplied, we need a newer one (see later).

### Qt6

#### Option 1: Using Qt official sources

Install the latest stable version of Qt6 LTS (6.2.4 at the moment): <http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/>.

If it tells you that XCode 5.0.0 needs to be installed, go to XCode > Preferences > Locations and make a selection in
the _Command Line Tools_ box.

Add Qt6 to your PATH environment variable, adding to your `.bash_profile` file the following line:

    export PATH=$PATH:~/Qt/6.2.4/clang_64/bin

Adjust accordingly if you customized the Qt install directory.

#### Option 2: Using Homebrew

Install Qt6:

    brew install qt6

### Cmake/OpenSSL

Building a Multipass package requires cmake 3.9 or greater. OpenSSL is also necessary at build time. The most convenient
means to obtain these dependencies is with Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>.

    brew install cmake openssl@3

Building
---------------------------------------

### Additional dependencies for Apple Silicon

If you encounter errors about missing `pkg-config` or `ninja`, install them with:

    brew install pkg-config ninja

This is required for CMake to find all necessary build tools and dependencies.

### Install Submodules

    cd <multipass>
    git submodule update --init --recursive

### Build Multipass

To build with official Qt sources do:

    cmake -Bbuild -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/6.2.4/clang_64

Alternatively if using Qt6 from Homebrew, do

    cmake -Bbuild -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt6

or, if on Apple silicon, brew will store the Qt binaries in a different location. Additionally, OpenSSL will be in a
similar location; `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@3`, which can be set in the project level `CMakeLists.txt` file.

    cmake -Bbuild -H. -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/qt6

Then start the build with:

    cd build/
    ninja

Take care to adjust the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the location you installed Qt above, or else cmake will complain about
missing Qt6.

Building in QtCreator
---------------------
QtCreator will be missing all the environment adjustments made above. To get cmake to successfully configure, open the
project and adjust the Build Environment (click the "Projects" icon of the left pane, scroll down). Then add the entries
to the $PATH as above, and add the variables reported by `opem config env`. CMake should now succeed, and QtCreator
allow you to edit the project files.


Creating a Package
------------------
This is as simple as running

    ninja package

or

    cpack

Once it is complete, you will have a Multipass.pkg file in the build directory.


Tips and Tricks for development on OSX
======================================

Getting console output
----------------------
To get console output from Multipass while installed, from one shell run:

    sudo launchctl debug system/com.canonical.multipassd --stdout --stderr

and then from another shell, restart the multipassd daemon with

    sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.canonical.multipassd

The console output from multipassd will appear on the former shell.
