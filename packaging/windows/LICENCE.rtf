Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line       meet the following conditions:\line\line       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\line           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\line\line       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\line           stating that You changed the files; and\line\line       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line           the Derivative Works; and\line\line       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line           as modifying the License.\line\line       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line       the conditions stated in this License.\line\line    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line\line    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line\line    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the\line       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line\line    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line\line    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line\line    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par

\b0\f3\fs16             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                Version 2, June 1991\line\line  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\line  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line                 Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\line General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\line your programs, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\line rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line distribute and/or modify the software.\line\line   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line authors' reputations.\line\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\line\line             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\line refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line along with the Program.\line\line You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line     parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Program.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line\line     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line     customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\line     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line     received the program in object code or executable form with such\line     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line\line The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\line code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\line special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line itself accompanies the executable.\line\line If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\line otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Program or works based on it.\line\line   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\line   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\line this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line Foundation.\line\line   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line\line                 NO WARRANTY\line\line   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\line OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\line PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\line YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\line PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\line POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par

\b0\f3\fs16            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                 Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\line           GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                 NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par

Additional Definitions.\line\line   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\line General Public License.\line\line   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\line other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\line\line   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\line by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\line Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\line of using an interface provided by the Library.\line\line   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\line Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\line with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\line Version".\line\line   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\line Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\line for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\line based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\line\line   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\line object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\line and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\line Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\line\line   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\line without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\line\line   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\line facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\line that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\line facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\line version:\line\line    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\line    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\line    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\line    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\line\line    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\line    this License applicable to that copy.\line\line   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\line\line   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\line a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\line code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\line material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\line layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\line (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\line    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line   4. Combined Works.\line\line   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\line taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\line portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\line the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\line    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\line    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\line    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\line    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line\line    d) Do one of the following:\line\line        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\line        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\line        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\line        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\line        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\line        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\line        Corresponding Source.\line\line        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\line        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\line        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\line        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\line        Version.\line\line    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\line    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\line    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\line    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\line    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\line    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\line    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\line    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\line    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\line    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\line    for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line\line   5. Combined Libraries.\line\line   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side by side in a single library together with other library\line facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\line License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\line choice, if you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\line    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\line    conveyed under the terms of this License.\line\line    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\line    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\line    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line\line   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\line versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\line Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\line applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that published version or of any later version\line published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\line received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\line whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\line apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\line permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\line Library.\par

The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under\line any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this\line licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their\line derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary\line purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of\line the fonts.\line\line DEFINITIONS\line "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\line Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may\line include source files, build scripts and documentation.\line\line "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components\line as received under this licence.\line\line "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\line or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\line Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to\line a new environment.\line\line "Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a\line copyright ownership of the Font Software.\line\line "Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily\line identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font\line Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.\line\line To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\line permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\line infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\line computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\line distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging\line a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some\line countries other activities as well.\line\line PERMISSION & CONDITIONS\line This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such\line rights are reserved.\line\line Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\line copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to\line the below conditions:\line\line 1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright\line notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone\line text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-\line readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those\line fields can be easily viewed by the user.\line\line 2) The font name complies with the following:\line (a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.\line (b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to\line avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.\line (c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be\line renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add\line additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the\line Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of\line the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of\line the new work, appended to that name.\line\line 3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the\line Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\line Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to\line acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with\line their explicit written permission.\line\line 4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must\line be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed\line under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this\line licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,\line except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document\line created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this\line licence.\line\line TERMINATION\line This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are\line not met.\line\line DISCLAIMER\line THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\line EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF\line MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF\line COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.
