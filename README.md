# What is Multipass?

Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed for developers who want to spin up a
fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command. It uses KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows and QEMU on macOS to run
virtual machines with minimal overhead. It can also use VirtualBox on Windows and macOS. Multipass will fetch Ubuntu
images for you and keep them up to date.

Multipass lets developers quickly create and manage Ubuntu virtual machines on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Itâ€™s ideal for testing, development, or learning Linux environments without setting up a full virtual machine manually.

Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud deployment on your laptop or workstation.

# Contributing

The Multipass team appreciates contributions to the project, through pull requests, issues, or discussions and questions
on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/multipass/21). Please read the policy sections below carefully
before contributing to the project. <!-- TODO: link to guidelines -->

## Building Multipass

Please follow the platform-specific build instructions in the files below:

* [BUILD.linux.md](./BUILD.linux.md) for Linux
* [BUILD.macOS.md](./BUILD.macOS.md) for macOS
* [BUILD.windows.md](./BUILD.windows.md) for Windows

### Generic build tips

**Qt version compatibility**
Multipass is tested with **Qt 6.2.4**. Newer patch versions along the 6.2 track (e.g. 6.2.8) should be fine. Newer minor versions may work, but they may cause compatibility issues.

**ARM64 and cross-compilation**
If you're using Apple Silicon (arm64) or cross-compiling, ensure that your `PATH` and `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` environment variables point to the correct Qt installation for your system architecture.

You may use your preferred package manager to install Multipass.
Note that only the official installers are supported.
See the [installation guide](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/multipass/en/latest/how-to-guides/install-multipass/) for details.

For backend support and system requirements, refer to the
[Multipass driver documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/multipass/en/latest/explanation/driver/).

If you notice outdated information or inconsistencies in these files, please [open an issue](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues) or, even better, submit a pull request!

You can also reference our [GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/actions) to see how Multipass is built and tested across platforms.

### Automatic linker selection

***Requires (>= CMake 3.29)***

To accelerate the build, the build system will attempt to locate and utilize `mold` or `lld` (respectively) in place of
the default linker of the toolchain. To override, set
[CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE.html#cmake-linker-type) at CMake
configure step.
